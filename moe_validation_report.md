# MoE Architecture Validation Report

## Summary
- **Status**: ❌ INVALID
- **Violations**: 3
- **Warnings**: 10

## Violations
1. ❌ Router does not enforce top-k constraint
2. ❌ Router does not implement capacity constraints
3. ❌ Load balancing is enabled but no load balancing loss found

## Warnings
1. ⚠️  Router missing recommended method: forward
2. ⚠️  Router missing recommended method: route_tokens
3. ⚠️  Router missing recommended method: compute_routing_weights
4. ⚠️  Router may not use configured top_k value (2)
5. ⚠️  Router may not properly normalize routing weights
6. ⚠️  MoE block may not implement expert dispatch
7. ⚠️  MoE block may not implement proper tensor routing
8. ⚠️  No gradient scaling found for sparse MoE training
9. ⚠️  Learned routing strategy but no linear layer found
10. ⚠️  Router may lack stability mechanisms (temperature/noise)

## Metrics
- **expected_sparsity**: 0.75
- **requires_runtime_validation**: ['NoOverflow property']

## Recommendations

1. **Router Implementation**: Ensure proper top-k constraint enforcement
2. **Capacity Constraints**: Implement Lean specification compliance  
3. **Load Balancing**: Add auxiliary loss for expert load balancing
4. **Testing**: Run generated test suite regularly
5. **Monitoring**: Add runtime validation of NoOverflow property

## Next Steps

1. Fix all violations before production deployment
2. Address warnings for optimal performance
3. Integrate generated test suite into CI/CD
4. Add runtime monitoring for capacity violations
