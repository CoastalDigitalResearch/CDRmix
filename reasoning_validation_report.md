4. Add explicit step validation and reasoning chain verification for CoT
5. Implement branch evaluation and pruning mechanisms for ToT efficiency
6. Address all critical reasoning issues before deployment

## Hybrid Hebbian-RL Implementation Guide

### Core Components Required
1. **Hebbian Proposer**: Ephemeral plastic-LoRA adapters with correlation-based learning
2. **RL Evaluator**: GRPO-style policy optimization over memory operations
3. **Memory System**: Working memory (streaming KV) + Episodic memory (FAISS-indexed)
4. **Decision System**: Branch scoring, acceptance thresholds, rollback mechanisms

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Plastic-LoRA adapters with proper rank/alpha scaling
- [ ] Hebbian correlation loss computation
- [ ] Memory operations: summarize, retrieve, splice_window, cache_write
- [ ] RL policy network for memory action selection
- [ ] GRPO optimization with KL divergence constraints
- [ ] Branch management with commit/rollback isolation
- [ ] Scale-adaptive parameters (1B/4B/40B/200B configurations)

### Performance Requirements
- Memory operations: <10ms per action
- Branch evaluation: <50ms per proposal
- Adapter updates: <5ms per modification
- Resource limits: max_branches (3-4), step_budget (64-160)

## Testing and Validation

### Immediate Actions
1. Run generated reasoning test suite
2. Fix all critical reasoning system issues
3. Implement missing core components
4. Add safety mechanisms (timeouts, resource limits)

### Continuous Validation
1. Monitor reasoning performance on benchmarks
2. Track memory utilization and efficiency
3. Validate branch acceptance rates
4. Profile reasoning latency and resource usage

### Integration Testing
1. Test end-to-end reasoning pipeline
2. Validate memory system integration
3. Test concurrent branch processing
4. Verify adapter isolation and rollback mechanisms

### Reasoning Quality Metrics
- Multi-step reasoning accuracy (>90% on benchmarks)
- Memory utilization efficiency (<5% overhead)
- Branch acceptance rate (70-85% for good balance)
- Adaptation speed (convergence within 10-20 steps)
